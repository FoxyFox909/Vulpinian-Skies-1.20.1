# 0.0.1b Modpack Initiallized ‚öôÔ∏èü¶ä‚öôÔ∏è

## Overview üìù

Vulpinian Skies has taken its first steps to being updated to 1.20.1. The decision to port was made after much consideration and analysis.

 Every major content-adding mod, including Create and all of its addons, are at this point caught up to 1.20.1. After performign an extensive "mod audit", the modpack has only lost 7 minor mods that do not have a version in 1.20.1, or a successor mod, or an otherwise obvious replacement.
 
 This version is not playable as it will not boot up. This is more or less just the preliminary modlist. All in all, the Vulpinian Skies modpack remains almost the same, with its essence intact, just updated!
 
  The modpack will now use semantic versioning x.y.z, where z are minor updates/patches, y are major updates, and x will be the legendary number, where once it is 1 as in 1.0.0, the modpack will be considered release-ready. There might additionalyl be letters to provide some extra meaning, such as b for beta.
 
 Anyone who has helped or contributed up to this point, will still receive credit! The Starter Huts that players have made on the server will be migrated to the new version, etc.
 
 ## Mini Blog / Vulpinian Yapping üó£
 
 The journey begins anew! There is much work to do. I will salvage and reuse everything I can, from all the progress that was made on 1.18.2, but there will still be over 5,000 lines of JavaScript need to be ported to the newer version. However, I am approaching this endeavor not only with renewed motivation and excitement, but also with a lot more experience.
 
 I have iterated on my modpack development workflow so that time can be used more efficiently, and I am also a significantly more experienced programmer today. As such, the most painful thing about rewriting all 5k lines of custom KubeJS scripts will mainly be reading my old, ameteur-ish code... and it being  JavaScript üò≠ I will surely make use of this "clean canvas" opoprtunity to make a cleaner, more organized codebase.
 
 I have also taken this chance to reconsider my development philosophy. Polish and attention to detail will still be the name of the game, but I will try and keep the bigger picture in mind, appropriately prioritizing what I work on depending on its impact. As much as I want things to be perfect, a perfect modpack is a modpack that will never be released because it will never be finished.
 
 "Polish, not perfection". All in all, quality will stay the same. Dev time will be more wisely and efficiently spent. The essence of the modpack will remain the same.
 
 One of the techniques I have implemented to help out in the development of this modpack is utilizing "temporary" or "throwaway" git repos that live within actively-developed modpack instances, which are instantiated with a git alias I crated to initializes and configures a repo for the express purpose of letting me know efficiently what configs,scripts, mods I have changed etc and thus need to reflect on the "main instance" when ready to release a new patch. This lessens the cognitive load and allows me to spend more brainpower developing rather than keeping track of things manually.
 
 As far as  1.20.1, among the reasons  why that version was chosen is because I am more or less placing a bet that it will be a better-supported version in the future. What that means is I'm a bit paranoid that by the time Clockwork is in a feature-complete and polished state, there might be a chance that the Clockwork dev team decides to not backport the complete and polished features to 1.18.2 (and I would NOT blame them, because it would be a fairly old version by then, depending on how long Clockwork takes to be developed).
 
 A lot of mods are already abandoning 1.18.2, which in itself has the positive aspect to it that it leads to a more stable modpack dev environment with less breaking changes and updates, but it is NOT good when such an important mod of the modpack remains in an unfinished state.
 
 If the rest of the modpack is polished and complete, except one of its (if not THE) most important mods, then I think we can agree that's a bit of a bruh moment. On the bright side, as stated in the overview above, most mods have caught up to 1.20.1, and there's a couple signals or indicators that tell me that it's warming up to be a decently stable version for modding.  Among those indicators, the whole Forge kerfuffle with Forge being the loader that better supports 1.20.1, and 1.20.1 being the last version before the Crafter is added, which definitely makes modders rethink the balance of things especially for tech mods.
 
 The biggest concern I have right now, is performance, as I have heard 1.20.1 has a performance drop. I will be on the lookout, using profilers such as Spark to measure how the modpack performs across the board. It does seem like some bugs are fixed, and the lighting engine was rewritten to be a lot better, so this gives me some hope!
 
 # 0.0.2b First Bootable Modpack Instance ‚öôÔ∏èü¶ä‚öôÔ∏è
 
 ## Overview üìù
 
 - The modpack is now able to boot up, and a world can be created and played in!
 
 - Vulpinian Skies has now introduced the groundbreaking mod Sinytra Connector, which allows playing Fabric mods in Forge to great success. This power will be used wisely, with a minimal amount of  small, non-major-content-providing mods. Currently, the only Fabric mod that Connector is powering is Antique Atlas 4 (only way to keep Antique Atlas from 1.18.2).
 
 - In an unfortunate turn of events for dragon lovers, Ice and Fire has been removed from the modpack. The reason is that it was found via profiling to cause heavy lag. The mod might be reconsidered at a later time, if it can be configured in some way to mitigate the lag, but it was already a bit problematic in 1.18.2 in terms of performance, so no promises are made.
 
 - Rubidium has been replaced by Embeddium, which should help more with performance.
 
 - ModernFix was added to the list of performance mods.
 
 The result of testing is that 100+ fps can be steadily reached in my machine, and the modpack loads in about 1 minute 15 seconds (before Modern Fix, it wa about 2 minutes 45 seconds, a significant performance increase),
