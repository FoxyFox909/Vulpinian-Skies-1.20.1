Vulpinian Skies - A Create-centered pack about Exploration, Engineering, and Magic

# Why this modpack? Isn't it just yet another Create pack?

Vulpinian Skies prides itself not on being an "expert" or a "tech" pack. AKA, it's a pack you can enjoy,  wether you like exploring and adventuring, or you want to delve into tech and engineering, or you want to become a powerful magic user, or even if you just want to have a quiet life as a farmer or brewer.

The philosophy of this pack is that it is the player's choice how they want to enjoy the world of Minecraft. 

There is progression, but it's not linear or forced in any way. You choose your own path. There are many paths, each with their own benefits and rewards and to progress and a variety of mods,  WHILE keeping mods purposeful and very carefully selected and curated to avoiding falling  into the "kitchen sink" territory.

Example Scenario: You can be the adventurer of the group and go explore a diverse world with thousands of structures and slay a wide variety of mobs and bosses and bring home the shiny loot, while your engineering-inclined friend stays home and automates everything with a carefully-expanded factory, all while being fed by your chill farmer friend, who always brings you a new and refreshing dish to help you stay strong and healthy, but will rain hell at you with his trusty shotgun if you step on his property unannounced.



Polish is extremely important to the philosphy of this pack. As my main and only pack I actively work on, it receives full attention to detail. Which leads to...

# Integratio, Integration, Integration!
